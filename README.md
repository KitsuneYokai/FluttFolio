# FluttFolio

**FluttFolio** is a easy to configure portfolio website built with Flutter, that you can netlify host on GitHub Pages, and configure with your own data.

The project is still really early in development, but im working on it :)

once the project is more stable, i will add a more detailed guide on how to configure the website with your own data and stuff.

# Idea

Instead of being forced to fork the project, and run it on a native machine, how about, i just display the layout.json on the website when the user saves, and the user can than just commit it to the repo? This way everyone with a browser can use it and don't need to install the flutter sdk on the machine. Maybe i allow both ways ðŸ™ƒ.
