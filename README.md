# FluttFolio

**FluttFolio** is a easy to configure portfolio website built with Flutter, that you can netlify host on GitHub Pages, and configure with your own data.

The project is still really early in development, but im working on it :)

once the project is more stable, i will add a more detailed guide on how to configure the website with your own data and stuff.
